h2. Overview

*Clever Algorithms: Nature-Inspired Programming Recipes* is an open source book that describes a large number of algorithmic techniques from the the fields of Biologically Inspired Computation, Computational Intelligence and Metaheuristics in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner such that they are accessible, usable, and understandable. This is a repository for the book project used during the development and ongoing maintenance of the books' content.

The book was first released in early 2011 for free on the website "CleverAlgorithms.com":http://cleveralgorithms.com and is available for purchase as a paperback from "Amazon":http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1446785068/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=inspiredalgor-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1446785068 and "Lulu":http://www.lulu.com/shop/jason-brownlee/clever-algorithms-nature-inspired-programming-recipes/paperback/product-14696556.html

bq. Implementing an Artificial Intelligence algorithm is difficult. Algorithm descriptions may be incomplete, inconsistent, and distributed across a number of papers, chapters and even websites. This can result in varied interpretations of algorithms, undue attrition of algorithms, and ultimately bad science. This book is an effort to address these issues by providing a handbook of algorithmic recipes drawn from the fields of Metaheuristics, Biologically Inspired Computation and Computational Intelligence, described in a complete, consistent, and centralized manner. These standardized descriptions were carefully designed to be accessible, usable, and understandable. Most of the algorithms described were originally inspired by biological and natural systems, such as the adaptive capabilities of genetic evolution and the acquired immune system, and the foraging behaviors of birds, bees, ants and bacteria. An encyclopedic algorithm reference, this book is intended for research scientists, engineers, students, and interested amateurs. Each algorithm description provides a working code example in the Ruby Programming Language.
