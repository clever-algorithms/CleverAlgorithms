<p>
<em>Clonal Selection Algorithm, CSA, CLONALG.</em>
</p>

<a id='taxonomy'><h2>Taxonomy</h2></a>
<p>
The Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) belongs to the field of Artificial Immune Systems.
It is related to other Clonal Selection Algorithms such as the Artificial Immune Recognition System, the B-Cell Algorithm (BCA), and the Multi-objective Immune System Algorithm (MISA).
There are numerious extensions to CLONALG including tweaks such as the CLONALG1 and CLONALG2 approaches, a version for classification called CLONCLAS,  and an adaptive version called Adaptive Clonal Selection (ACS).
</p>


<a id='inspiration'><h2>Inspiration</h2></a>
<p>
The Clonal Selection algorithm is inspired by the Clonal Selection theory of acquired immunity.
The clonal selection theory credited to Burnet was proposed to account for the behavior and capabilities of antibodies in the acquired immune system  [<a href='#Burnet1957'>Burnet1957</a>] [<a href='#Burnet1959'>Burnet1959</a>]. Inspired itself by the principles of Darwinian natural selection theory of evolution, the theory proposes that antigens select-for lymphocytes (both B and T-cells). When a lymphocyte is selected and binds to an antigenic determinant, the cell proliferates making many thousands more copies of itself and differentiates into different cell types (plasma and memory cells). Plasma cells have a short lifespan and produce vast quantities of antibody molecules, whereas memory cells live for an extended period in the host anticipating future recognition of the same determinant. The important feature of the theory is that when a cell is selected and proliferates, it is subjected to small copying errors (changes to the genome called somatic hypermutation) that change the shape of the expressed receptors and subsequent determinant recognition capabilities of both the antibodies bound to the lymphocytes cells surface, and the antibodies that plasma cells produce.
</p>


<a id='metaphor'><h2>Metaphor</h2></a>
<p>
The theory suggests that starting with an initial repertoire of general immune cells, the system is able to change itself (the compositions and densities of cells and their receptors) in response to experience with the environment. Through a blind process of selection and accumulated variation on the large scale of many billions of cells, the acquired immune system is capable of acquiring the necessary information to protect the host organism from the specific pathogenic dangers of the environment. It also suggests that the system must anticipate (guess) at the pathogen to which it will be exposed, and requires exposure to pathogen that may harm the host before it can acquire the necessary information to provide a defense.
</p>


<a id='strategy'><h2>Strategy</h2></a>
<p>
The information processing principles of the clonal selection theory describe a general learning strategy.
This strategy involves a population of adaptive information units (each representing a problem-solution or component) subjected to a competitive processes for selection, which together with the resultant duplication and variation ultimately improves the adaptive fit of the information units to their environment.
</p>


<a id='procedure'><h2>Procedure</h2></a>
<p>
Algorithm (below) provides a pseudocode listing of the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) for minimizing a cost function.
The general CLONALG model involves the selection of antibodies (candidate solutions) based on affinity either by matching against an antigen pattern or via evaluation of a pattern by a cost function. Selected antibodies are subjected to cloning proportional to affinity, and the hypermutation of clones inversely-proportional to clone affinity. The resultant clonal-set competes with the existent antibody population for membership in the next generation. In addition, low-affinity population members are replaced by randomly generated antibodies. The pattern recognition variation of the algorithm includes the maintenance of a memory solution set which in its entirety represents a solution to the problem. A binary-encoding scheme is employed for the binary-pattern recognition and continuous function optimization examples, and an integer permutation scheme is employed for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

<a id='heuristics'><h2>Heuristics</h2></a>
<ul>
<li> The CLONALG was designed as a general machine learning approach and has been applied to pattern recognition, function optimization, and combinatorial optimization problem domains.</li>
<li> Binary string representations are used and decoded to a representation suitable for a specific problem domain.</li>
<li> The number of clones created for each selected member is calculated as a function of the repertoire size $N_c=round(\beta \cdot N)$, where $\beta$ is the user parameter $Clone_{rate}$.</li>
<li> A rank-based affinity-proportionate function is used to determine the number of clones created for selected members of the population for pattern recognition problem instances.</li>
<li> The number of random antibodies inserted each iteration is typically very low (1-2).</li>
<li> Point mutations (bit-flips) are used in the hypermutation operation.</li>
<li> The function $exp(-\rho \cdot f)$ is used to determine the probability of individual component mutation for a given candidate solution, where $f$ is the candidates affinity (normalized maximizing cost value), and $\rho$ is the user parameter $Mutation_{rate}$.</li>
</ul>


<a id='code_listing'><h2>Code Listing</h2></a>
<p>
Listing (below) provides an example of the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CLONALG) implemented in the Ruby Programming Language.
The demonstration problem is an instance of a continuous function optimization that seeks $\min f(x)$ where $f=\sum_{i=1}^n x_{i}^2$, $-5.0\leq x_i \leq 5.0$ and $n=3$. The optimal solution for this basin function is $(v_0,\ldots,v_{n-1})=0.0$.
The algorithm is implemented as described by de Castro and Von Zuben for function optimization  [<a href='#Castro2002a'>Castro2002a</a>].

Hidden at the back of a technical report on the applications of Artificial Immune Systems de Castro and Von Zuben  [<a href='#Castro1999'>Castro1999</a>] proposed the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA) as a computational realization of the clonal selection principle for pattern matching and optimization.
